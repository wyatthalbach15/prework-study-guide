# Prework Study Guide

## This project was motivated by the urge to learn as much as I can about coding with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in as quick of a time as possible. This project will aid in that endeavor by allowing me to keep track of all my notes and have a study guide by which to learn the important things from class. In doing this project, I learned that some things that I may not even think of as a problem is something that can be fixed helped with coding. I also learned all about three basic types of coding and how I will be able to use them as I go forward in the bootcamp as well as in my professional career.
